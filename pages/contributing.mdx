# Contributing to Proofly

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Proofly! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moroii69/proofly.git
cd proofly-lib
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 guidelines with these specific requirements:

- Line length maximum: 88 characters
- Use type hints for all function parameters
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use f-strings for string formatting

Example of properly formatted code:

```python
def analyze_health_metrics(
    metrics: HealthMetrics,
    threshold: float = 0.5
) -> AnalysisResult:
    """
    Analyze health metrics and return results.

    Args:
        metrics: Health metrics to analyze
        threshold: Analysis threshold value

    Returns:
        AnalysisResult containing analysis outcome
    """
    return AnalysisResult(
        score=calculate_score(metrics),
        confidence=calculate_confidence(metrics, threshold)
    )
```

## Testing

> **⚛️ Deprecation Notice**  
> This testing framework has been discontinued as of version 1.2.4.

<details>
<summary>Legacy Testing Documentation</summary>

**Note:** The following information is preserved for historical purposes and projects using versions prior to 1.2.4.

We use pytest for testing. All new code should include tests:

```python
# tests/test_analyzer.py
def test_health_analyzer():
    metrics = DiabetesMetrics(
        blood_glucose=120,
        hba1c=6.5,
        blood_pressure=130
    )
    
    analyzer = HealthAnalyzer()
    result = analyzer.analyze_metrics("diabetes", metrics)
    
    assert result.health_score >= 0
    assert result.health_score <= 100
    assert isinstance(result.recommendations, list)
```

To run tests:
```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=proofly tests/  # For coverage
```
</details>

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

We follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for adding tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

3. Push your changes:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

4. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue
   - Screenshots/examples if relevant
   - Test results

## Documentation

When adding new features, please update:

1. API documentation
2. Usage examples
3. Docstrings
4. README.md if necessary

Example of good documentation:

```python
class HealthAnalyzer:
    """
    Main class for analyzing health metrics.
    
    Attributes:
        config (Dict): Configuration parameters
        models (Dict): Loaded prediction models
    
    Example:
        analyzer = HealthAnalyzer()
        result = analyzer.analyze_metrics(metrics)
    """
```

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review. We expect:

1. No failing tests
2. Code coverage ≥90%
3. Proper documentation
4. Clean commit history

## Development Workflow

1. Check existing issues/create new issue
2. Discuss approach in issue
3. Fork repository
4. Create feature branch
5. Write code and tests
6. Submit PR
7. Address review comments
8. Merge after approval

## Environment Setup Tips

Recommended VS Code settings:

```json
{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
